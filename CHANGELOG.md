- Sample configuration files for each recipe
- Add TensorFlow-Distributed recipe

### Changed
- Updated configuration docs to detail which properties are required vs. those
that are optional
- SSH tunnel user is now added with a default expiry time of 7 days which can
be modified through the pool configuration file

### Fixed
- Non-shipyard docker image node prep with new azure-storage package
- Temp file creation used for environment variables now works cross-platform
