No experience with the Azure Batch SDK is needed; run your Docker Batch\r\ntasks through easy-to-understand configuration files!\r\n\r\nMajor Features\r\n--------------\r\n* Automated [Docker Host Engine](https://docker.io) installation on compute\r\n  nodes\r\n* Accelerated Docker image deployment at scale to compute pools consisting of\r\n  a large number of compute nodes via peer-to-peer distribution of Docker\r\n  images among the VMs\r\n* Automated Docker Private Registry instance creation on compute nodes backed\r\n  to Azure Storage if specified\r\n* Automated\r\n  [Azure File Docker Volume Driver](https://github.com/Azure/azurefile-dockervolumedriver)\r\n  installation and share setup for SMB/CIFS backed to Azure Storage if\r\n  specified\r\n* Seamless integration with Azure Batch job, task and file concepts along with\r\n  full pass-through of the Azure Batch API to containers executed on compute\r\n  nodes\r\n* Support for task dependencies to allow for complex processing pipelines with\r\n  Docker containers\r\n* Support for multi-instance tasks to accomodate Dockerized MPI applications\r\n  on compute pools\r\n* Transparent assist for creating Docker containers utilizing Infiniband/RDMA\r\n  for MPI on\r\n  [HPC low-latency Azure VM instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-a8-a9-a10-a11-specs/)\r\n  (STANDARD\\_A8 and STANDARD\\_A9)\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\nSimply clone the repository:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/Azure/batch-shipyard.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nor [download the latest release](https://github.com/Azure/batch-shipyard/releases).\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\nThe Batch Shipyard tool is written in Python. The client script is compatible\r\nwith Python 2.7 or 3.3+. You will also need to install the\r\n[Azure Batch](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-batch) and\r\n[Azure Storage](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-storage) python packages.\r\nInstallation can be performed using the [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt)\r\nfile via the command `pip install --user -r requirements.txt` (or via `pip3`\r\nfor python3).\r\n\r\nHost OS (Compute Node) Support\r\n------------------------------\r\nBatch Shipyard is currently only compatible with Linux Batch Compute Pools\r\nconfigured via\r\n[VirtualMachineConfiguration](http://azure-sdk-for-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/azure/batch/models/virtual_machine_configuration.html).\r\nPlease see the list of\r\n[Azure Batch supported Marketplace Linux VMs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/batch-linux-nodes/#list-of-virtual-machine-images)\r\nfor use with Batch Shipyard.\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\nPlease refer to\r\n[this guide](https://github.com/Azure/batch-shipyard/blob/master/docs/00-introduction.md)\r\nfor a complete primer on concepts and usage.\r\n\r\nLimitations\r\n-----------\r\n* Oracle Linux is not supported with Batch Shipyard at this time.\r\n* Task dependencies are incompatible with multi-instance tasks. This is a\r\n  current limitation of the underlying Azure Batch service.\r\n* Only Intel MPI can be used in conjunction Infiniband/RDMA on Azure Linux VMs.\r\n  This is a current limitation of the underlying VM and host drivers.\r\n\r\nChangeLog\r\n---------\r\nSee the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/Azure/batch-shipyard/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\r\nfile.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\nThis project has adopted the\r\n[Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).\r\nFor more information see the\r\n[Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or\r\ncontact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any\r\nadditional questions or comments.\r\n",
