No experience with the\r\n[Azure Batch SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-batch-samples) is needed; run\r\nyour Dockerized tasks with easy-to-understand configuration files!\r\n\r\n## Major Features\r\n* Automated [Docker Host Engine](https://www.docker.com) installation tuned\r\nfor Azure Batch compute nodes\r\n* Automated deployment of required Docker images to compute nodes\r\n* Accelerated Docker image deployment at scale to compute pools consisting of\r\na large number of VMs via private peer-to-peer distribution of Docker images\r\namong the compute nodes\r\n* Comprehensive data movement support: move data easily between locally\r\naccessible storage systems, Azure Blob or File Storage, and compute nodes\r\n* Automated Docker Private Registry instance creation on compute nodes with\r\nDocker images backed to Azure Storage if specified\r\n* Automatic shared data volume support:\r\n  * [Azure File Docker Volume Driver](https://github.com/Azure/azurefile-dockervolumedriver)\r\n    installation and share setup for SMB/CIFS backed to Azure Storage if\r\n    specified\r\n  * [GlusterFS](https://www.gluster.org/) distributed network file system\r\n    installation and setup if specified\r\n* Seamless integration with Azure Batch job, task and file concepts along with\r\nfull pass-through of the\r\n[Azure Batch API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/batch-api-basics/)\r\nto containers executed on compute nodes\r\n* Support for\r\n[Azure Batch task dependencies](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/batch-task-dependencies/)\r\nallowing complex processing pipelines and DAGs with Docker containers\r\n* Transparent support for\r\n[GPU accelerated Docker applications](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)\r\non [Azure N-Series VM instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-n-series-preview-availability/)\r\n([Preview](http://gpu.azure.com/))\r\n* Support for multi-instance tasks to accommodate Dockerized MPI and multi-node\r\ncluster applications on compute pools with automatic job cleanup\r\n* Transparent assist for running Docker containers utilizing Infiniband/RDMA\r\nfor MPI on HPC low-latency Azure VM instances:\r\n  * [A-Series](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-a8-a9-a10-a11-specs/): STANDARD\\_A8, STANDARD\\_A9\r\n  * [H-Series](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-sizes/#h-series): STANDARD\\_H16R, STANDARD\\_H16MR\r\n  * [N-Series](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-sizes/#n-series-preview): STANDARD\\_NC24R (not yet available)\r\n* Automatic setup of SSH tunneling to Docker Hosts on compute nodes if\r\nspecified\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nInstallation can be performed in any of the following methods:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Azure/batch-shipyard.git`\r\n2. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/Azure/batch-shipyard/releases)\r\nand extract to your local machine\r\n3. Run the [alfpark/batch-shipyard:cli-latest](https://hub.docker.com/r/alfpark/batch-shipyard)\r\nDocker image\r\n\r\nPlease see [this page](docs/01-batch-shipyard-installation.md) for more\r\ninformation regarding installation and requirements.\r\n\r\n## Batch Shipyard Compute Node OS Support\r\nBatch Shipyard is currently only compatible with\r\n[Azure Batch supported Marketplace Linux VMs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/batch-linux-nodes/#list-of-virtual-machine-images).\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nPlease refer to\r\n[this guide](https://github.com/Azure/batch-shipyard/blob/master/docs)\r\nfor a complete primer on concepts, usage and a quickstart guide.\r\n\r\nPlease visit the\r\n[recipes directory](https://github.com/Azure/batch-shipyard/blob/master/recipes)\r\nfor different sample Docker workloads using Azure Batch and Batch Shipyard\r\nafter you have completed the primer.\r\n\r\n## ChangeLog\r\nSee the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/Azure/batch-shipyard/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\r\nfile.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\nThis project has adopted the\r\n[Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).\r\nFor more information see the\r\n[Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or\r\ncontact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any\r\nadditional questions or comments.\r\n",
