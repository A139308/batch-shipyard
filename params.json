No experience with the\r\n[Azure Batch SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-batch-samples) is needed; run\r\nyour batch-style Docker tasks with easy-to-understand configuration files!\r\n\r\n## Major Features\r\n* Automated [Docker Host Engine](https://docker.io) installation on compute\r\nnodes\r\n* Automated deployment of required Docker images to compute nodes\r\n* Accelerated Docker image deployment at scale to compute pools consisting of\r\na large number of VMs via private peer-to-peer distribution of Docker images\r\namong the compute nodes\r\n* Automated Docker Private Registry instance creation on compute nodes with\r\nDocker images backed to Azure Storage if specified\r\n* Automated\r\n[Azure File Docker Volume Driver](https://github.com/Azure/azurefile-dockervolumedriver)\r\ninstallation and share setup for SMB/CIFS backed to Azure Storage if\r\nspecified\r\n* Seamless integration with Azure Batch job, task and file concepts along with\r\nfull pass-through of the\r\n[Azure Batch API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/batch-api-basics/)\r\nto containers executed on compute nodes\r\n* Support for task dependencies allowing complex processing pipelines and\r\ngraphs with Docker containers\r\n* Support for multi-instance tasks to accomodate Dockerized MPI applications\r\non compute pools\r\n* Transparent assist for creating Docker containers utilizing Infiniband/RDMA\r\nfor MPI on\r\n[HPC low-latency Azure VM instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-a8-a9-a10-a11-specs/)\r\n(i.e., STANDARD\\_A8 and STANDARD\\_A9)\r\n* Automatic set up of SSH tunneling to Docker Hosts on compute nodes if\r\nspecified\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nSimply clone the repository:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/Azure/batch-shipyard.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nor [download the latest release](https://github.com/Azure/batch-shipyard/releases).\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nThe Batch Shipyard tool is written in Python. The client script is compatible\r\nwith Python 2.7 or 3.3+. You will also need to install the\r\n[Azure Batch](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-batch) and\r\n[Azure Storage](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-storage) python packages.\r\nInstallation can be performed using the [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt)\r\nfile via the command `pip install --user -r requirements.txt` (or via `pip3`\r\nfor python3).\r\n\r\n## Batch Shipyard Compute Node OS Support\r\nBatch Shipyard is currently only compatible with Linux Batch Compute Pools\r\nconfigured via\r\n[VirtualMachineConfiguration](http://azure-sdk-for-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/azure/batch/models/virtual_machine_configuration.html).\r\nPlease see the list of\r\n[Azure Batch supported Marketplace Linux VMs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/batch-linux-nodes/#list-of-virtual-machine-images)\r\nfor use with Batch Shipyard.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nPlease refer to\r\n[this guide](https://github.com/Azure/batch-shipyard/blob/master/docs)\r\nfor a complete primer on concepts and usage.\r\n\r\nPlease visit the\r\n[recipies directory](https://github.com/Azure/batch-shipyard/blob/master/recipies)\r\nfor different sample Docker workloads using Azure Batch and Batch Shipyard\r\nafter you have completed the primer.\r\n\r\n## Limitations\r\n* Oracle Linux is not supported with Batch Shipyard at this time.\r\n* Task dependencies are incompatible with multi-instance tasks. This is a\r\n  current limitation of the underlying Azure Batch service.\r\n* Only Intel MPI can be used in conjunction Infiniband/RDMA on Azure Linux VMs.\r\n  This is a current limitation of the underlying VM and host drivers.\r\n\r\n## ChangeLog\r\nSee the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/Azure/batch-shipyard/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\r\nfile.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\nThis project has adopted the\r\n[Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).\r\nFor more information see the\r\n[Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or\r\ncontact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any\r\nadditional questions or comments.\r\n",
